# Booksriver 📚🌊📝

Booksriver is an Android app designed to help you track what you're reading, write reviews, and follow other users. The app is built using Kotlin and Compose, utilizing best practices in the Model-View-ViewModel architecture pattern. 

It's a pet project created to learn and explore the capabilities of Kotlin and Compose, therefore it's not available (yet...?) on the Play Store.

Books are fetched from the Google Books API, all the backend stuff is available in [this repo](https://github.com/lorisgir/Booksriver-Backend-Server).

## Features 🚀

Booksriver has a range of features to make tracking your reading experience an easy and enjoyable process. Here are some of the key features:

- 🌓 Night mode: switch to a dark background for comfortable reading in low light conditions
- 📖 Landscape and tablet support: optimized for larger screens
- 📝 Write reviews: give feedback on the books you've read and share your opinion with others
- 👥 Follow other users: get recommendations based on what other users are reading
